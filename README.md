# split_people_by_last_name
Splits people into groups based on last names.

At Regis we came across a situation where we have a group of people that needed to be split up by last name.  In our case, it is students that need faculty advisors assigned to them.  The process of assigning them to faculty involves going through a list of people sorted by last name.
